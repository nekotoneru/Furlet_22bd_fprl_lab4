The sky is so blue today!
I forgot my notebook at home...
Can you help me with this problem?
She said she would call me later.
Wow, that's amazing!
They went to the park, didn't they?
I love how peaceful it feels here.
Please, don't forget to bring your passport!
What a beautiful sunset we saw.
Oh no, I spilled my coffee - oops!
